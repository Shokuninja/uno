MVP Classes include:
1. Card Class
2. Player Class
3. Game Class

GOING FORWARD:

For now have deck be a list of cards in the game class .

When we distribute the cards to the players,
we're going to pop cards from the deck list and append them to the player hand .

Probably also need a Game attribute called pile (discard pile?) F

Need a new method maybe called "play" F
While (self.game_over == False) loop over the players, play a card or draw a card F

    Maybe:
        Display opponents hand length F
        Display what each opponent played F

    Display user's hand F
    Display last card played F
    if player.name == Player 1, ask user to pick a card F

Maybe an attribute

WHAT'S LEFT:

    1. Impliment Turns .
    2. We're basically there, let's head out, get some food and some sleep and resume tomorrow
